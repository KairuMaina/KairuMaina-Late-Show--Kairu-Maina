# Late Show API

This is a Flask-based API for managing episodes, guests, and appearances on a late-night show. It allows you to perform CRUD operations on episodes, guests, and appearances, and links them together with a many-to-many relationship through appearances.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Flask-Migrate

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KairuMaina/KairuMaina-Late-Show--Kairu-Maina.git
cd KairuMaina-Late-Show--Kairu-Maina
```

### Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (if not already created) and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Up the Database

Before running the app, set up the database and apply migrations.

```bash
# Initialize the database (creates app.db file)
flask db init

# Create the migration scripts
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"

# Apply the migrations to the database
flask db upgrade
```

### Seed the Database (Optional)

If you want to populate the database with some initial data, run the seeding script. Make sure you have the provided CSV file (`data.csv`) available or create your own sample data.

```bash
# Seed the database
flask db seed
```

## Running the App

To run the Flask application locally, use the following command:

```bash
flask run --port 5555
```

Your application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5555`.
